### A one-time-use script to remove some Ubuntu company bloat, install useful packages and support for file formats and replace Firefox with Brave

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any damages or distress caused by the program in the event that something goes wrong, like always, never install & run things from users online until you have done the necessary research.

# ü§ì How 2 Run
FIRST: Make sure youre system meets these requirements (running the program without meeting these requirements will result in issues):
- Ubuntu Long Term Service (LTS) Version 21 or higher
- Fresh or almost fresh install of Ubuntu
- Sudo apt-get/apt-get functions correctly

SECOND: Install the .sh file and move it to your Home (root) directory.

THIRD: Right-click the .sh file and select "properties" then enable "run as executeable" if not already enabled.

LAST: Double click on the .sh and enter your passsword into the terminal window that appears to run the program (the system will automatically restart when the script is finished).
